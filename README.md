# My Weather Channel

## Description

1. This weather application is a very useful tool. It's designed for users who need a quick check for a city about the current and forecast weather. The application has a clean user interface and provides a simple user experience.

2. When the user inputs a city search for it, the dashboard will then display the current weather details for that city, and 5-day forecasts display as well.

- The weather details include the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- The UV index color indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- The 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

3. After that search, the city is saved and stored on the left-side history column. The user can click on it later anytime, to get the live current weather and the 5-day forecasts.

4. This application can save multiple cities as tabs, the user doesn't need to type the searched cities again.
